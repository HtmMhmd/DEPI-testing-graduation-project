## User Stories & Use Cases

### User Story 1: QA Engineer Running Tests
**As a** QA Engineer,  
**I want to** run all tests with a simple command,  
**So that** I can quickly validate application quality without complex setup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A batch file exists to run all tests with a single command
- Tests execute in an appropriate order and with proper configuration
- Clear reporting of test results is provided
- Screenshots are captured for failed tests

### User Story 2: Developer Checking Specific Feature
**As a** Developer,  
**I want to** run specific tests related to my feature,  
**So that** I can ensure my changes don't break existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests can be filtered by test class or method name
- Test execution is fast for a subset of tests
- Clear feedback is provided on test status
- Detailed failure information is available when tests fail

### User Story 3: DevOps Engineer in CI/CD Pipeline
**As a** DevOps Engineer,  
**I want to** integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline,  
**So that** every code change is automatically verified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests can run in headless mode
- Tests execute reliably in a CI environment
- Test results are properly reported in CI logs
- Test failure causes the build to fail appropriately

### User Story 4: QA Manager Reviewing Coverage
**As a** QA Manager,  
**I want to** see test coverage reports,  
**So that** I can identify areas that need additional testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test reports show which features and scenarios were tested
- Statistics on test pass/fail are available
- Trends in test execution can be tracked
- Gaps in test coverage are identifiable

### Use Case: Cross-Browser Test Execution
**Actor:** QA Engineer  
**Pre-condition:** Test framework is installed and configured  
**Main Flow:**
1. QA Engineer selects desired browser(s) for testing
2. QA Engineer initiates cross-browser test execution
3. System configures and launches each selected browser
4. System executes all tests on each browser
5. System generates a report showing results for each browser

**Alternative Flow:**
- If a browser is not installed, system provides a clear error message
- If tests fail on specific browsers, detailed browser-specific information is provided

**Post-condition:** Test reports are generated showing cross-browser results

## Functional Requirements

### Test Framework Core
